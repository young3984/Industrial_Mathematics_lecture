# Industrial_Mathematics_lecture
- Class on Industrial Mathematics.(there were some assignments.)
- Working on a project as a team.

## Assignment
1. [prey-predator model](https://github.com/young3984/Industrial_Mathematics_lecture/tree/master/Assignment/Assignment(1)) 
2. [least square method](https://github.com/young3984/Industrial_Mathematics_lecture/tree/master/Assignment/Assignment(2))
3. [Approximation of Partial Differential Equations](https://github.com/young3984/Industrial_Mathematics_lecture/tree/master/Assignment/Assignment(3))

## Project
- Three-dimensionalization through projected cross-sections
- This project was conducted by [신영민](https://github.com/young3984), 정예진, 정재훈 and 김성윤.
### 1. Plan
|Week|Contents|
|----|--------|
|Week1|Setting the topic and writing a plan & learning mathematical knowledge|
|Week2|The simple figure projection and the stereoscopic practice using the Matlab(1)|
|Week3|The simple figure projection and the stereoscopic practice using the Matlab(2)|
|Week4|Character Data Survey & Character Stereoscopicization Matlab(1)|
|Week5|Character Data Survey & Character Stereoscopicization Matlab(2)|
|Week6|Report writing and final presentation|

For detailed plans, see the [plan](https://github.com/young3984/Industrial_Mathematics_lecture/blob/master/Project/Plan%26PPT/Plan.pdf).

### 2. Process
#### (1) Mathematical knowledge
- Projection
- The reverse process of projection
#### (2) Practice
- Using Matlab [[code]](https://github.com/young3984/Industrial_Mathematics_lecture/tree/master/Project/Practice)
